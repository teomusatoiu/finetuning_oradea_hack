# From Good to Great: Hands-On Fine-Tuning for Hackathon Success

Welcome to our **Fine Tuning Workshop**! This repository designed to kickstart your journey into fine-tuning with OpenAI's technologies during this hackathon. Here, youâ€™ll find three hands-on exercises that will help you master the art of fine-tuning models to achieve greater accuracy and performance in various tasks.

## ðŸš€ How to Get Started

1. **Fork** this repository to begin your fine-tuning adventure.
2. Each exercise includes:
   - A **starter Jupyter Notebook** to guide you through the fine-tuning process.
   - A **dataset** tailored to the specific task.
3. As you work through each notebook, youâ€™ll apply fine-tuning techniques and explore the impact they have on model performance.

## ðŸ’¡ Need Help?

If youâ€™re looking for guidance or a peek at the solutions, head over to the `solution` branch where youâ€™ll find fully worked examples and code. Use it as a reference, but donâ€™t forget to try solving the exercises yourself first!

## ðŸ§  What's Inside?

- **Exercise 1:** Distillation - Wine Labelling
- **Exercise 2:** Fine Tuning for function calling - Program your drone! 
- **Exercise 3:** Fine Tuning for images - Better medical diagnosis

Each exercise is designed to build on the previous one, so make sure to complete them in order for the best learning experience!

## ðŸŽ‰ Letâ€™s Get Hacking!

We hope this repo serves as a useful starting point for your hackathon success. Experiment, learn, and most importantly, have fun!

Happy Hacking!
