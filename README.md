# From Good to Great: Hands-On Fine-Tuning for Hackathon Success

Hello everyone, this repo is meant to provide a starting point for the 3 different excercises that I want to propose. Please fork/clone this repository and use it as guidance. 

Each exercise comes with a starting Jupyter Notebook as well as a dataset that you can use for fine tuning. 

If you want to see the solution, please head over to the `solution` branch and you will see the full code in there. 

Happy Hacking!
